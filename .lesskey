#env
#
# [2002­10­03] Zrajm C Akfohg.
#
# I don't set my less(1) related environment variables here anymore. I do it in
# my `~/.zshenv' file. If all variables are set in the shell, I can also change
# them in the shell, this in comfortable, compared to changing them here and
# re­running `lesskey' each time I experiment with something.
#
# The settings I had here before I removed them was:
#
#LESS            = -RXQiz-2
#LESSCHARDEF     = 8bcccbcc13bc4b95.33b.
#LESSBINFMT      = *s\%o
#JLESSKEYCHARSET = latin1
#
# These settings enable:
#
#    o Latin­1 charset (Swedish characters ÅÄÖ).
#    o ANSI graphics (LESSCHARDEF is used to convince less that textfiles may
#      also contain the Escape character - less defaults to acting as if such
#      files are binary).
#    o Case­insensetive searching (case sensetivity is enables if you use one
#      or more uppercase letters).
#    o Silent operation (never beep, bell character is displayed as ^G
#      instead).
#    o No clearing of screen on exit.
